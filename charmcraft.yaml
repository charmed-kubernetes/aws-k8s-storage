        Source registry of aws images.

        By setting to a value, each image listed in the releases manifest
        has its image-registry replaced.

        If unset, the manifests will use the image registry from the kube-control relation

        example)
          juju config aws-k8s-storage image-registry=''

          juju config aws-k8s-storage --reset image-registry

    storage-release:
      type: string
      description: |
        Specify the version of storage-provider as defined by the `release`
        tags of https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver

        example)
          juju config aws-k8s-storage storage-release='v1.11.2'
        
        A list of supported versions is available through the action:
          juju run-action aws-k8s-storage/0 list-releases --wait
        
        To reset by to the latest supported by the charm use:
          juju config aws-k8s-storage --reset storage-release
        
        The current release deployed is available by viewing
          juju status aws-k8s-storage
